# Ask [@kosalanuwan](https://github.com/kosalanuwan) anything!

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository with GitHub Discussions. It is originally forked from [@mdo's feedback repo](https://github.com/mdo/ama) and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're better off [asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll end up getting a much faster response back that way.

## Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [starting a new discussion](https://github.com/kosalanuwan/ama/discussions/new?category=q-a) on this repo.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry, if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

## Read some questions

Check out the [Ansered Questions](https://github.com/kosalanuwan/ama/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aanswered) filter to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.

## Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@kosalanuwan](https://twitter.com/kosalanuwan) on Twitter.
