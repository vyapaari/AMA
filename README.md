# Ask [@Vyapaari](https://github.com/vyapaari) anything!

This is a quick little Ask-Me-Anything, redirects to GitHub Discussions. It is originally forked from [@kosalanuwan's] repo (https://github.com/kosalanuwan/ama) and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're better off [asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll end up getting a much faster response back that way.

## Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as starting a new [discussion](https://github.com/kosalanuwan/ama/discussions/new?category=q-a) here.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry, if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

## Read some questions

Check out the Answered [Questions?](https://github.com/vyapaari/AMA/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aanswered), you can filter to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.

## IRC Libra.Chat 

If you have something quick,private and easy, just ping me on IRC. 140 characters makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@drupin](https://web.libera.chat/) on Libera.Chat.
